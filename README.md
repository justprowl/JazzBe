	<p align="left">American music developed especially from ragtime and blues and
<br>
	 characterized by propulsive syncopated rhythms, polyphonic ensemble playing, varying
<br>
	  degrees of improvisation, and often deliberate distortions of pitch and timbre.
<br>
<br>	  
	There are many conflicting and confusing stories about the origins of the word jazz. Few,
<br>
 	if any reference works on language are ready to make any definite pronouncements as to
 <br>
  	its etymology. The Oxford English Dictionary has written evidence for two distinct senses of
<br> 
	the noun (meaning "energy" and "rubbish") before it was used to refer to a type of music.
<br>	
<br>
	However, the earliest written use for all three of these senses of the noun occurs within
<br>	
	 a three year span; this, coupled with the fact that jazz would have certainly been in spoken
<br>
	  use for some time prior to this (there are other senses of the word, such as "to copulate
<br>	   
	with," which would have been considered vulgar, and unlikely to have been printed),
<br> 
	means that we really don't know which sense of the word was the first to arrive in English.
<br>	
<br>	
	Definition - marked by a considerable departure from the conventional or traditional
 <br>
	The earliest evidence we have for far-out comes in magazine articles from the early 1950s, on the subject of jazz.
<br>
	Far out has a similarity to out of this world, another idiom that has often been described
<br> 
	as having originated in the language of jazz. 
<br>
<br>
	While out of this world may indeed have been driven into the linguistic mainstream through association with jazz,
<br>
	 it appears to have originated in African American vernacular prior to this, with the same meaning ("superb"),
<br>
	 but applied to various and sundry aspects of entertainment, and not just jazz.
<br>	 
	 You may very well think of schmaltz as being the word you reach for when trying to
<br>	  
	 describe your grandmother's sofa (which is fine; she doesn't care for your upholstery
<br>	 
	  choices either). We have no opinion on either sofa.
<br>
<br>	  
	Schmaltz comes from the Yiddish shmalts, which literally means "rendered fat." Oddly
<br>
 	enough, when the word was taken into English it was in a context that had no culinary
 <br>
  	connection; the word was initially found applied to music that was seen as less than hip.
<br> 
  	Schmaltz is the noun form, and schmaltzy the adjective; both words date from the early 1930s.
<br>
<br>
  	The humble gig, the first half of today's gig economy, is a word of unknown origin. It is
<br> 
	orthographically identical to many other gigs, including the ones meaning "something
<br> 
	that whirls or is whirled," "a light 2-wheeled one-horse carriage," and "an arrangement of
<br> 
	hooks to be drawn through a school of fish in order to hook their bodies," but
<br>	
	 etymologically unrelated. This gig begins appearing in writing in the mid-1920s, initially in
<br>	
	 reference to society or jazz bands working at a club or spot for some non-extended period.
<br>
<br>
 	Jam has had many and varied meanings over the past three hundred or so years that it
 <br>  
    has been used as a verb in our language, and it seems likely that over the next several
<br> 
    hundred years it will continue to attract additional new senses. Although this particular
 <br>   
     sense of jam has broadened somewhat over the past 80 years, taking on new parts of
 <br>    
      speech and encompassing musical genres ranging from male mid-life crisis basement
 <br>     
       music to I'd really like to not go to that concert, the origins of musical jamming come from
 <br>      
        describing jazz music in the 1930s.
